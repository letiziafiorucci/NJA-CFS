# NJA-CFS (Not Just Another Crystal Field Software)

**NJA-CFS** is a Python-based comprehensive toolkit for crystal field/ligand field calculations.  
It enables simulations of electronic structure properties—including magnetic properties—for transition metal and lanthanoid complexes.

The toolkit provides access to multiple CF/LF parametrization schemes and includes advanced routines for manipulation and rotation of crystal field parameters.

## Requirements

This is **not a Python package**, and it does not require installation via `pip`.  
To use NJA-CFS, simply clone the repository and follow the instructions in the documentation.

 **A complete list of required Python libraries** and usage instructions is available in the [`docs/`](./docs) folder.
